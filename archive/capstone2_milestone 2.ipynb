    "The data is obtained by measuring the vertical acceleration of each side of the front axel of a train. As the axel is one piece these measurements are only partially independent as vibration can be transmited from oneside through the axel. The data collection setup is completely separate from the train command and control system and is manually initiated before the automated test train is dispatched. The data recorder is retrieved after the test train completes the circuit of the track network. The labels are the event log files pertaining to the test train from the command and control network. \n",

    "While both the accerometer data and event log have time stamps these are not sychronised and have substantially different temporal resolution. The event log data is given to the second while the accelerometer is given to the ten thousandth of a second. The acceleration data begins at 10:05 AM and goes to XXX for YYY minutes of data. The first logged event occurs at CCC AM and the last event occurs at VVV for spanning BBB minutes."
